#2048 for LiveView#

This is an implementation of the popular game 2048 as a plugin for the Sony Ericsson LiveView. 

###Features###
 - Full gameplay from LiveView
 - Resume game
 - Tiles up to 16384
 - Nice graphics

###Known Problems###
I experience connection issues while using the plugin for long periods of time, but my LiveView sucks so it may not be related to the software.


###Installation###
Soon this will be on Google Play but for now download the `2048 LiveView.apk` file from the bin folder and install it on your device.
It should then show up in the plugins folder on your LiveView.
