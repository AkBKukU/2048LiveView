This is an implementation of the popular game 2048 as a plugin for the Sony Ericsson LiveView. 

###Features###
 - Full gameplay from LiveView
 - Scoring
 - Persistent high score
 - Resume game
 - Tiles up to 16384
 - Nice graphics

###Known Problems###
I experience connection issues while using the plugin for long periods of time, but my LiveView sucks so it may not be related to the software.


###Installation###
Download [2048 LiveView.apk](https://github.com/AkBKukU/2048LiveView/releases/download/1.0/2048.LiveView.apk) from the bin folder and install it on your device.
It should then show up in the plugins folder on your LiveView.
